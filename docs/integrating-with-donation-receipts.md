# Integrating With Donation Receipts

If you are using de.systopia.donrec to create donation receipts, it can be integrated with CiviOffice to create cover letters for the receipts. The minimum version required for this is de.systopia.donrec 2.1.

In the general settings for the donation receipts extension (``/civicrm/admin/setting/donrec?reset=1``), determine the document you want to use as the template for the cover letters. A new output format option will be available in the donation receipts dialogue then (`` Individual PDFs with cover letter (CiviOffice)``). Your cover letters will be created separately from the receipts, but sorted so they can be printed or merged together easily.
